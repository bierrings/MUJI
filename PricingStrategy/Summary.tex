In this chapter, I have concerned the market using Porters 5 Forces in order to support the pricing strategy of my proposal. One might argue that Porters 5 Forces is no longer viable and not comprehensive enough to predict the market dynamics of today, which are affected by technology, disruption and globalisation. With that said, I think it gives a picture of the market, and I certainly think it supports my final choice of pricing strategy. The pricing strategy I found to be the best for MUJI is the perceived value pricing.
