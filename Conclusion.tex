In this report, I have analysed, evaluated and compared various aspects to a variety of challenges, in order to specify my recommendations to be discussed at the management meeting next week. The consumer confidence in Denmark is at the highest level since 2006, and the population is getting ready to prioritise quality over price again \cite{ConsumerLifestyles}. This is just one of many aspects indicating the attractiveness of the danish market. The competition is tough, but I have identified a gap in the market, which represents an opportunity for MUJI's entry.

Considering my recommendations regarding consumer positioning, pricing strategy, future trends and cultural aspects, my final advice for MUJI is to proceed and enter the danish market. I am very certain that MUJI will become a success, and they will be able to establish a competitive advantage. This advice only applies with my recommendations as a prerequisite.
