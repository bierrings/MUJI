In this chapter, I have conducted an analysis in order to recommend the best possible consumer positioning for MUJI in Denmark. Firstly I have identified the core segments, where after I have evaluated and compared each of these segments using the SOCC approach. Based on the analysis I have chosen a target group and finally drawn together the optimum marketing mix to confront this group. The result of my analysis is illustrated in figure \ref{PositioningMap} above. The approach I have had to the challenge is just one of many ways to approach it. Another approach could be to use Porters 5 Forces, the BCG model, 4 C's and so fourth. I think the most important aspect in this matter is to always keep the needs of the customer in focus, which my approach most certainly does.
