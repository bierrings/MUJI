The following chapter addresses my recommendation for the best consumer positioning in Denmark for MUJI. My analysis is based on the S-T-P\footnote{Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning} process. Throughout this chapter I will focus on the market for housewares and furniture, because I assess the markets for respectively clothes and beauty products are too competitive, thus it would be very difficult to establish a competitive advantage. %Måske komme ind på at der heller ikke er mange produkter de udbyder
MUJI has the best opportunity to establish a competitive advantage in the market for housewares and furniture. 



\section{Segmentation, targeting and positioning}
In this section I will provide an analysis based on the S-T-P process. First step is to identify the core segments. Subsequently, these segments will be analysed and compared in order to determine the size and potential of the individual segments. Next step is to select the target group expected to generate the greatest profit on the basis of an appropriate marketing mix. Finally, I will give my recommendation for the best possible consumer positioning of the company.
