I have chosen to focus on three segments, because these segments represent the largest and most attractive potential target groups for MUJI. The segments I have chosen to focus on does not represent all 100\% of MUJI's customers - there might be customers younger than 18 and older than 59 years old with different preferences, but in my opinion the three segments stated below are the core segments. First of all, the segments only represent people living in Denmark, since this is the market to enter. Additionally, I only focus on the B2C market.
\newpage
The three chosen segments are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
\item \textbf{Young and agnostic}\\
This segment is the young and agnostic men and women aged 18-29. This segment represent students, trainees, graduates, part-time employees and people living with their parents as well as the people with their own homes.
\item \textbf{Settled middle youth}\\
This segment is the middle youth men and women aged 30-44. This segment represents the full-time employees, parents of young children, owners of detached houses, vehicle owners and settled families.
\item \textbf{Hard working mid-lifers}\\ 
This segment is the mid-lifers aged 45-59. This segment represents people who work a lot and have been on the labour market for a long time, and parents whose children have become young adults and might have left home.  
\end{enumerate}
