CUSTOMER COMPLAINT BEHAVIOR: AN EXAMINATION OF CULTURAL VS. SITUATIONAL
FACTORS (session 8 ppt slide 69-)
\\The research question is:“To what extent are differences in complaining behavior due to situational vs. cultural factors?” 
\\In this context situational factors refer to store policies, etc., whereas culture refers to factors such as individualism vs. collectivism
\\Previous research indicates that in collectivist  and high-uncertainty avoidance cultures, dissatisfied customers are unlikely to complain to the seller, and
  \\   - instead are more likely to silently exit (taking their
\\     - business elsewhere) and warn others about the
  \\   - offending company.
\\3 studies were conducted
